![React.hx](/master/react-hx.png?raw=true "React.hx")

React.hx is a Haxe extern implementation of ReactJS created by Franco Ponticelli (https://github.com/fponticelli)
Check out the ReactJS site (http://reactjs.org) for great information and tutorials!

## Status: Proof of concept

Note that this is a "proof of concept" with the puprose of figuring out how to match ReactJS with the great Haxe toolset.
Don't expect any production ready code here!

## Dependencies

For these examples to work, you need the following

- Haxe 3.1.3 (http://haxe.org/download/) with Neko
- NodeJS and NPM package manager (http://nodejs.org/)	
- SSH enabled commandline tool. (On osx/linux any terminal should work, on Windows Git-bash should do it.)

### Haxe libraries

All Haxe libraries neede are included in the /libs folder, so there should be no need for haxlib installations.

## Examples

Have a look in the examples folders. There you can find more information about how to compile and run.
